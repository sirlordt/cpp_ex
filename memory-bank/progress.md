## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions
- **Simple Demo Application**: Started with a basic "Hello World" application to demonstrate the environment setup.
- **Modern C++ Standard**: Chose C++23 to showcase modern C++ features.
- **CMake + Conan**: Selected for build system and dependency management to follow industry best practices.
- **Containerization**: Implemented Docker containerization to demonstrate deployment practices.

### Current Direction
- **External Library Integration**: Successfully integrated try_catch_guard library from GitHub.
- **Utility Components**: Planning to implement common utility functions and classes.
- **Testing Implementation**: Currently focusing on implementing and expanding test coverage.
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Keeping the memory bank up-to-date with project changes.
- **AI Assistant Integration**: Using Claude AI to maintain consistent documentation and knowledge transfer.
- **Maintaining Simplicity**: Keeping the application simple to focus on environment and tooling.
- **Containerization Optimization**: Emphasis on creating minimal, secure containers.

### Future Considerations
- **Feature Expansion**: Consider adding more C++ features to demonstrate language capabilities.
- **Testing Expansion**: Expand test coverage and implement more advanced testing techniques.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Implement CI/CD to showcase modern development workflows.
- **Additional Dependencies**: Consider adding more external libraries to demonstrate dependency management.

## Known Issues

### Build System
- No known issues

### Containerization
- No known issues

### Application
- Limited functionality (by design)
- No error handling for invalid inputs

### Testing
- Signal handling modifications required for Catch2 to work with sanitizers

### External Library Integration
- Added automatic download and integration of try_catch_guard library from GitHub
- Modified build.sh to check for and download the library if needed
- Updated CMakeLists.txt to include and link with the try_catch_guard library
- Integrated try_catch_guard tests with the project's test suite
- Added proper error handling for download failures

### Testing Framework Integration
- Added Catch2 testing framework via FetchContent in CMakeLists.txt
- Created modify_catch2.sh script to handle signal conflicts
- Implemented build_test.sh and run_test.sh scripts
- Added integration tests for basic C++ functionality
- Integrated Address Sanitizer and Undefined Behavior Sanitizer
- Set up proper test configuration in CMakeLists.txt

- Configured Claude to maintain a "Memory Bank" of project documentation
- Set up structured approach to documentation with core files
- Defined workflows for Plan Mode and Act Mode
- Established documentation update processes
- Used SQLite to store configuration in VSCode's database

### Optional Test Building
- Modified CMakeLists.txt to make test building optional:
