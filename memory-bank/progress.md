- [ ] Implement error handling
- [ ] Add logging functionality
- [ ] Demonstrate fmt library usage

### Testing
- [x] Set up test framework (Catch2)
- [x] Add basic integration tests
- [x] Implement test automation scripts
- [ ] Add more comprehensive test cases
- [ ] Implement component-specific unit tests
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting

### CI/CD
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure automated builds
- [ ] Implement automated testing
- [ ] Set up container registry integration

### Documentation
- [ ] Add developer documentation
- [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] Document API (if expanded)

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions
- **Simple Demo Application**: Started with a basic "Hello World" application to demonstrate the environment setup.
- **Modern C++ Standard**: Chose C++23 to showcase modern C++ features.
- **CMake + Conan**: Selected for build system and dependency management to follow industry best practices.
- **Containerization**: Implemented Docker containerization to demonstrate deployment practices.

### Current Direction
- **External Library Integration**: Successfully integrated try_catch_guard library from GitHub.
- **Utility Components**: Planning to implement common utility functions and classes.
- **Testing Implementation**: Currently focusing on implementing and expanding test coverage.
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Keeping the memory bank up-to-date with project changes.
- **AI Assistant Integration**: Using Claude AI to maintain consistent documentation and knowledge transfer.
- **Maintaining Simplicity**: Keeping the application simple to focus on environment and tooling.
- **Containerization Optimization**: Emphasis on creating minimal, secure containers.

### Future Considerations
- **Feature Expansion**: Consider adding more C++ features to demonstrate language capabilities.
- **Testing Expansion**: Expand test coverage and implement more advanced testing techniques.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Implement CI/CD to showcase modern development workflows.
- **Additional Dependencies**: Consider adding more external libraries to demonstrate dependency management.

## Known Issues

### Build System
- No known issues

### Containerization
- No known issues

### Application
- Limited functionality (by design)
- No error handling for invalid inputs

### Testing
- Signal handling modifications required for Catch2 to work with sanitizers
