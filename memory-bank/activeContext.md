  - Configures CMake with proper toolchain

- Added new script **run_test.sh**:
  - Checks for and installs required dependencies
  - Builds tests if they don't exist
  - Executes the integration tests
  - Provides clear output of test results

### Integration Tests
- Created tests/integration_tests.cpp:
  - Implemented test cases for vector operations
  - Implemented test cases for string operations
  - Implemented test cases for arithmetic operations
  - Implemented test cases for boolean logic
  - Used Catch2's SECTION feature for better test organization

- Updated CMakeLists.txt:
  - Added testing support with enable_testing()
  - Integrated Catch2 via FetchContent
  - Added Address Sanitizer and Undefined Behavior Sanitizer
  - Added tests subdirectory

- Added tests/CMakeLists.txt:
  - Configured test executable
  - Set up proper linking with Catch2
  - Configured sanitizer options
  - Integrated with CTest
  - Set up environment variables for Address Sanitizer

### Memory Bank Maintenance
- Updated memory bank files to reflect the latest changes
- Documented testing framework integration
- Updated progress status

### External Library Integration
- Added integration with try_catch_guard library from GitHub
- Configured build.sh to automatically download and integrate the library
- Set up CMake to properly link with the try_catch_guard library
- Integrated try_catch_guard tests with the project's test suite

### Planned Utility Components
- Planning to add utility components in src/utils.hpp and src/utils.cpp
- These files will contain common utility functions and classes
- Currently in design phase, files created but not yet implemented

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks
1. Improve build system flexibility
   - âœ… Add option to build without tests
1. Implement utility functions in utils.hpp and utils.cpp
2. Explore and utilize try_catch_guard library functionality
3. Add more comprehensive test cases
4. Implement unit tests for specific components
5. Add examples of using the fmt library in tests
6. Improve test coverage

### Medium-term Tasks
1. Enhance the demo application with more advanced C++ features
2. Add examples of using the fmt library in the main application
3. Improve error handling in the application
4. Add more comprehensive documentation for developers

### Long-term Tasks
1. Implement CI/CD pipeline examples
2. Add more advanced containerization techniques
3. Demonstrate integration with common C++ frameworks
4. Create examples of multi-threading and concurrency

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### External Library Integration
- **Decision**: Integrate try_catch_guard library from GitHub
- **Rationale**: Provides exception handling capabilities and additional testing
- **Status**: Implemented

### Testing Framework
- **Decision**: Use Catch2 as the testing framework
- **Rationale**: Modern, header-only library with good C++ support and features
- **Status**: Implemented

### Sanitizer Integration
- **Decision**: Enable Address Sanitizer and Undefined Behavior Sanitizer
- **Rationale**: Helps catch memory errors and undefined behavior early
- **Status**: Implemented

### Signal Handling Modification
- **Decision**: Modify Catch2's signal handling to work with sanitizers
- **Rationale**: Prevents conflicts between Catch2's signal handlers and sanitizers
- **Status**: Implemented

### Test Organization
- **Decision**: Use Catch2's SECTION feature for better test organization
- **Rationale**: Allows for more readable and maintainable tests
- **Status**: Implemented

### AI Assistant Integration
- **Decision**: Integrate Claude AI assistant with custom instructions for documentation
- **Rationale**: Ensures consistent documentation maintenance and knowledge transfer
- **Status**: Implemented

### Documentation Strategy
- **Decision**: Maintain comprehensive memory bank documentation
- **Rationale**: Establish clear context for the project to facilitate future development
- **Status**: Ongoing

### Code Organization
- **Decision**: Maintain the current simple structure for the demo
- **Rationale**: Keeps the focus on demonstrating the environment setup rather than complex application logic
- **Status**: Accepted

### Dependency Management
- **Decision**: Use Conan for dependency management
- **Rationale**: Provides a modern, reliable way to manage C++ dependencies
- **Status**: Implemented

### Containerization Approach
- **Decision**: Generate minimal Docker containers with only required dependencies
- **Rationale**: Reduces container size and potential security vulnerabilities
- **Status**: Implemented

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Style
- Use modern C++ idioms and features
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Prefer explicit over implicit constructs

### Testing Patterns
- Use descriptive test names
- Organize tests with SECTION blocks
- Test both normal and edge cases
- Keep tests focused and independent

### Build Process
- Use CMake for build configuration
- Integrate Conan for dependency management
- Automate build steps with scripts
- Separate build scripts for application and tests

### Documentation
- Maintain comprehensive documentation in the memory bank
- Document key decisions and their rationales
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Store useful commands and references in git_commands.md

### Containerization
- Use minimal base images
- Include only necessary dependencies
- Configure proper permissions and non-root users
